                RAPID INTEGRATION OF LLM







The Problem with Basic LLMs in Trading
After deploying the language model from the first part of the article, the system worked correctly with technical indicators: RSI, MACD, and volume analysis, and the model generated BUY or SELL trading signals. However, during testing on a demo account for a week, a significant issue emerged.

Let's look at a specific example. The model generated a BUY signal on the EURUSD pair at an RSI of 32, which formally corresponds to the oversold zone. After entering the position, the price continued to fall another 200 pips, and only reversed upward three days later. The stop-loss was triggered, and the deposit dropped by 3%. The following day, a similar situation repeated itself on the GBPUSD: at an RSI of 28, the model generated a BUY signal, but the price fell another 300 pips, resulting in an additional 3% loss.

The problem lies not in the correctness of the indicator calculations, but in the lack of practical experience. The basic language model functions like a novice trader who has mastered the theoretical rule "RSI below 30 is a buy signal," but lacks knowledge of how a specific currency pair reacts to oversold conditions under various market conditions. For example, the model doesn't take into account that EURUSD may continue to fall during a strong daily downtrend during the Asian session, despite low RSI values.

The basic LLM understands the theoretical foundations of technical analysis, but lacks empirical data on the behavior of specific instruments. Specifically, the model doesn't recognize that EURUSD, with an RSI of 25, statistically falls an average of 40 pips before reversing, GBPUSD in a similar situation can decline by 150 pips, and MACD divergence on H4 for USDCHF leads to a successful reversal in 70% of cases, while for USDCAD this figure is only 40%.

Solving this problem requires a model trained on real historical statistics of specific currency pairs, which understands their behavior not from textbooks, but from the analysis of thousands of real market situations.

Solution: fine-tuning using historical data


Fine tuning is the process of further training a pre-trained model on a specialized dataset. To draw an analogy with practical trading, it's like a finance graduate joining a proprietary trading firm and trading for the first month under the guidance of an experienced senior trader. The mentor shows them thousands of real trades and explains in detail why each one worked or failed. After a month of this practice, the graduate transforms into a more experienced trader, possessing not only a theoretical foundation but also a practical understanding of the real-world behavior of trading instruments.

Finetuning applies a similar approach to the language model. The process is divided into three sequential stages: generating a training dataset from historical MetaTrader 5 data, training the model using the Ollama framework, and verifying the results through a fair backtest without leaking future data. Each stage addresses a specific technical challenge and requires careful attention to implementation details.


Generating a balanced dataset
An analysis of the EURUSD chart over the past six months reveals a price increase from 1.0500 to 1.1200, representing a 700-point increase. If we were to create a training dataset by sequentially sampling all examples from this period, the resulting sample would be significantly imbalanced: approximately 70% of the examples would be labeled UP (price increase), while only 30% would be labeled DOWN (price decrease).

A model trained on such an imbalanced dataset optimizes the loss function by simply remembering that the correct answer is UP in most cases. This will lead to an apparent accuracy of 70% on the training data, but to disastrous results in real trading when the market situation changes and a correction or downtrend begins.

The solution to this problem is to balance the classes in the dataset. Download a six-month price history and identify all points where the price increased over 24 hours, as well as all points where the price decreased. Then, 500 examples of increases and 500 examples of decreases are randomly selected from these sets. The result is a balanced dataset of 1,000 examples with a 50/50 class split.

Why was a 24-hour prediction horizon chosen?

The 24-hour forecast horizon (96 15-minute bars) was chosen based on several considerations. First, it provides a sufficient time interval for significant market movements to manifest themselves, which can be captured by technical indicators. Short-term horizons of 1-4 hours contain too much market noise and random fluctuations, which reduces predictability. Second, the 24-hour period allows for the influence of different trading sessions (Asian, European, and American), which is important for currency pairs. Third, from a practical standpoint, it is a convenient interval for an automated trading system that analyzes the market once a day.

Important note: this is not the only possible choice. Different trading strategies may benefit from different timeframes (for example, 4-6 hours for intraday trading or 48-72 hours for swing trading). Your choice of timeframe should be consistent with your trading philosophy and risk profile.

Why were these currency pairs chosen?

The current implementation uses four major currency pairs: EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCHF, and USDCAD. This choice was driven by several factors. These pairs are characterized by high liquidity and relatively tight spreads, which is critical for algorithmic trading. They exhibit different behavior patterns: EURUSD and GBPUSD often exhibit similar dynamics due to the correlation between EUR and GBP, while USDCHF often moves in the opposite direction (negatively correlated with EURUSD), and USDCAD has its own specific behavior related to oil prices.

Critical note: Mixing all pairs into a single model can lead to averaging of patterns and reduced accuracy. A more optimal approach may be training separate specialized models for each pair or grouping similar pairs (e.g., EURUSD + GBPUSD in one model, USDCHF + USDCAD in another). This requires more computational resources but can significantly improve results.

Why 1000 examples are enough

The number of training examples (1,000) represents a compromise between training quality and computational costs. Fine-tuning a pre-trained model (one that understands the general principles of technical analysis) requires less data than training it from scratch. 1,000 examples is the minimum volume that allows the model to identify consistent patterns in the behavior of the selected currency pairs.

Important caveat: this is a relatively small dataset by machine learning standards. Larger datasets (5,000-10,000 examples) can yield significantly better results, especially if the model is used across a wide range of market conditions. The small dataset size limits the model's ability to generalize to new situations.


Implementation of dataset generation
The script downloads 180 days of historical data, iterates through each time point, determines the result after 24 hours, and generates an equal number of growth and decline examples for each currency pair. The process takes 5-10 minutes, depending on the connection speed to the broker's server.

The script downloads history for 180 days, loops through each point, looks at what happened twenty-four hours later, and collects an equal number of up and down examples. The process takes five to ten minutes.

Each example contains the current market situation and the actual result in 24 hours:

def create_training_example(symbol, row, future_row, current_time):
    actual_price_24h = future_row[ 'close' ]
    price_change = actual_price_24h - row[ 'close' ]

         "response" : response,

    }
A critical detail: the response uses real data from the future. The model learns not from theoretical calculations like "RSI below 30 means growth," but from what actually happened on a specific currency pair at a specific time. EURUSD, with an RSI of 25 on October 20th, fell another forty pips. GBPUSD, with an RSI of 28 on November 15th, rose eighty pips. The model remembers these patterns.

After generating the dataset, save it to a file:

def save_dataset(dataset: list , filename: str = "dataset/finetune_data.jsonl" ):
     with  open (filename, 'w' , encoding= 'utf-8' ) as f:
         for item in dataset:
            f.write(json.dumps(item, ensure_ascii= False ) + '\n' )
     print ( f"Dataset saved: {filename} " )
     return filename
The resulting file is approximately one megabyte in size and contains a thousand examples in JSONL format. Each line is one training example with a prompt and the correct answer.


Stage Two: Finetune via Ollama
Before Ollama, fine-tuning required significant technical knowledge: a deep understanding of PyTorch, proper configuration of CUDA for GPUs, knowledge of model quantization methods, and writing complex training scripts with properly configured hyperparameters. Ollama radically simplifies this process, reducing it to creating a configuration file (Modelfile) with training examples and running a single command in the terminal.

Why choose the llama3.2:3b model?

The llama3.2 model with 3 billion parameters was chosen as the optimal balance between prediction quality and computational requirements. Smaller models (1B parameters) demonstrate insufficient accuracy in analyzing complex market situations. Larger models (7B and 13B parameters) require significantly more RAM and response time, which is critical for a real-time trading system. The 3B model can run on a standard computer with 8-16 GB of RAM and a mid-range graphics card, while still delivering acceptable analysis quality.

Justification of hyperparameters:

A temperature of 0.55 is a compromise between determinism and flexibility. At a value of 0.2, the model always generates virtually identical responses, which reduces adaptability to different market situations. At a value of 0.9, responses become more creative but less predictable and accurate. A value of 0.55 allows the model to vary its analysis depending on the context while maintaining sufficient stability.
top_p 0.92 — kernel sampling, where the model considers only those tokens whose combined probability is 92%. This filters out highly unlikely variants while maintaining sufficient diversity in the generation.
top_k 30 — the model considers only the 30 most likely next tokens at each generation step. This balances the quality and diversity of responses.
num_ctx 8192 — the context window size. The model can hold up to 8,000 tokens in memory simultaneously, which is sufficient for analyzing the current market situation and accounting for the last 10-15 closed trades for context.
num_predict 768 is the maximum length of the generated response. This is sufficient for a structured analysis of all indicators and the formation of a specific recommendation.
repeat_penalty 1.1 — a small penalty for repeating tokens, which makes responses more varied and less formulaic.
Ollama takes the 1.9 GB base llama3.2:3b model, adds a system prompt with analysis rules, and embeds 50 training examples from the dataset as a few-shot context. The model "sees" how to correctly analyze specific market situations and what results are obtained after 24 hours.

An important technical note: Ollama doesn't fully retrain the neural network's weights (which would require gradient descent and backpropagation). Instead, it uses in-context learning: training examples are embedded in the model's context, and the model learns from them using the attention mechanism. This is faster and requires fewer resources, but may be less efficient than a full-fledged fine-tuning with weight updating.

The model creation process takes 2-5 minutes on a computer with a modern graphics card (GTX 1660 or higher). Once completed, you have a specialized trading model trained on the real history of 4 currency pairs.


Testing the model's performance
Once the model has been created, it is necessary to quickly test its functionality:

test_prompt = """EURUSD 2025-11-21 10:00
Current price: 1.0850
RSI: 32.5
MACD: -0.00015
ATR: 0.00085
Volumes: 1.8x
BB position: 0.15
Stochastic K: 25.0
Analyze and give an accurate price forecast in 24 hours.

test_result = ollama.generate(model= "shtencoaitrader-3b" , prompt=test_prompt)
 print (test_result[ 'response' ])
The model should provide a structured response with a movement direction, confidence level, target price, and a detailed analysis of each indicator. If the response follows the specified format and appears logical, we can move on to the next stage—backtesting.

Honest backtest without data leakage

One of the most common and critical errors in backtesting trading systems is look-ahead bias. Let's consider a typical incorrect approach: the developer downloads a month's worth of historical data, calculates technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) for the entire data set at once, then iterates through each candlestick and generates trading signals.

The problem is that when calculating the RSI for a candlestick that closed at 10:00 on November 10, the RSI formula uses all available data, including bars for November 10 at 11:00, 12:00, and later. This happens because the indicators are calculated for the entire pandas dataframe at once, using vectorized operations. As a result, the model "knows" what will happen at 11:00 and later on November 10 at 10:00.

This data leakage leads to unrealistically good results in backtesting (win rates can reach 75-80%), which completely fall apart on a real account, where the model shows a 40-45% win rate and generates losses.

Correct implementation of backtesting

A correct backtest must strictly adhere to the time sequence: at each step, the model has access only to the data that would be available in real time at that moment.

The key point is in the line `historical_data = data[sym].iloc[:current_idx + 1 ].copy()`. We only take data up to and including the current moment. Anything after the `current_idx` index is not considered by the model.

The model analyzes the situation at the current_idx time, makes a decision, and opens a virtual trade. We then fast-forward ninety-six bars, look at the current_idx + 96 index , take the closing price, and calculate the profit. No future information is used in making the decision.

Run a backtest on the last thirty days of history. The system will analyze approximately thirty entry points per month across four currency pairs, for a total of one hundred twenty potential trades. Of these, forty to fifty trades will be opened with a confidence level above sixty-five percent.

The result looks something like this:

The key implementation point is in the line historical_data = data[sym].iloc[:current_idx + 1].copy() . We use pandas slicing to extract only the data up to and including the current_idx index. Anything after this index is irrelevant to the model—this data hasn't yet happened from the perspective of the current point in time.

The sequence of actions in the cycle:

the model analyzes the situation at the moment current_idx,
makes decisions based on available data,
opens a virtual trade at the current price;
we "rewind time" forward 96 bars (24 hours),
we look at the current_idx index + 96 and take the actual closing price,
We calculate profit/loss based on the actual price movement.
No future information is used in making trading decisions.

Interpreting backtest results

Run a backtest on the last 30 days of trading history. The system will analyze approximately 30 entry points per month (one entry point per day) across 4 currency pairs, providing 120 potential trading opportunities. Of these, 40-50 trades will be opened that meet the confidence criterion of over 65%.

Expected results:

Backtest results

Before running a backtest, it's important to understand the limitations of our custom Python tester:
Lack of spread accounting.  The current implementation doesn't account for the spread between bid and ask prices. In real trading, the spread on EURUSD is 0.5-2 pips, depending on the broker and market conditions. This means that 1-4 pips of additional costs must be subtracted from each trade. For 47 trades, this could amount to an additional loss of $50-$200.
No commission accounting.  Many brokers charge a commission per trade (e.g., $3-7 per lot). For 47 trades with an average lot size of 0.5, this adds up to approximately $70-$150.
Slippage.  In live trading, your order may be executed at a price 1-3 pips different from the requested price in volatile conditions.
Optimistic TP = 3×SL.  A take-profit to stop-loss ratio of 3:1 is not always realistic and can lead to premature closing of profitable positions or failure to reach target levels.
The quality of signals depends on parse_answer().  Parsing the model's response is critical. If parse_answer() incorrectly interprets the model's response, this will lead to erroneous signals.
Small training set size.  1,000 examples is too small for robust learning. The model may overfit to specific patterns during the training period and generalize poorly to new data.
Lack of testing under various market conditions.  A 30-day backtest may not cover various market conditions (strong trends, flats, high volatility, news events).
Realistic model estimate:  taking into account spreads, commissions, and slippage, actual returns could be 30-50% lower than backtest results. Instead of +18.47% per month, expect +9-13% in the best-case scenario.

As a result of the backtest, you received a graph of funds managed by the model:



More than 20% per month, provided training is done on completely synthetic data (and they perform much better – the profit when training on real labeled data is on average 2-3 times worse) – this is excellent in my opinion.

The win rate when training on synthetic data fluctuates between 54 and 59%, but when training on real data, I was unable to achieve a win rate higher than 52%. 

As for live trading in real time, everything is also very, very pleasing:





Transitioning to Live Trading: Preparation and Risks
Speaking of live trading, after a successful backtest, the question arises of launching the system on a real account. This transition is critical and requires careful preparation. Most traders make one of three fatal mistakes: launching the system directly on a real account without testing it on a demo, using an excessively large position size for the first trades (in an attempt to make a quick buck), or failing to prepare a contingency plan in case of losses or technical failures.

The correct sequence is as follows: First, two weeks of trading on a demo account, fully simulating real-world conditions, then a month on a micro account with a minimum deposit of $100 and a lot size of 001. Only after confirming consistent results should you switch to the main account, gradually increasing your position size.

Setting up a demo account for testing

Open MetaTrader 5, go to the File menu, and select Open Account. In the list of brokers, find any major broker, such as Alpari, NPBFX, or Forex Club. Select the Demo account type and USD as the currency. Specify a deposit of $10,000 and leverage of 1:100. These are standard conditions for testing.

After creating a demo account, run the system in mode four:

The system will launch and operate in an endless loop. Every twenty-four hours, it analyzes all configured currency pairs, makes decisions, and opens positions. After 24 hours, it automatically closes the positions and repeats the cycle.

Monitor the following metrics on a demo account for two weeks. Your win rate should be in the 53-62% range. If it's consistently below 50%, the system requires some adjustments. The maximum drawdown shouldn't exceed 15%. If the drawdown reaches 20%, reduce your risk per trade from 1% to 0.5%.

The average winning streak lasts three to five consecutive trades. A losing streak is usually shorter: two to three trades. If you see a streak of ten losing trades in a row, stop the system and check whether market conditions have changed dramatically.

Technical aspects of 24-hour operation

The system must run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Your home computer isn't up to the task. It might reboot for Windows updates at the most inopportune moment. Or the power might go out, and the system might miss an important signal.

Solution: rent a VPS (virtual private server). This is a remote computer that runs 24/7 in a data center with backup power and redundant internet connections. Prices start at $10 per month.

Choose a VPS with Windows Server 2019 or 2022, at least four gigabytes of RAM, and a dual-core processor. It's best to choose a server in the same country as your broker's server. If your broker is based in London, choose a VPS in the UK. This reduces order latency from 50 milliseconds to 5.

After renting a VPS, connect to it via Remote Desktop, install MetaTrader 5, and log in to your trading account. Then install Python, the MetaTrader 5 library, and Ollama. Download your trained model with the command ollama pull shtencoaitrader-3b . Run the trading script.

Set up the script to run automatically when the server starts. Place this file in Windows startup via the shell:startup folder. Now, whenever the server restarts, the system will automatically resume trading. Here's the .bat file with the contents:

@echo off
cd C:\trading
python ai_trader_ultra_with_finetune.py --mode=live --auto-confirm


What did you get?
In just a few hours, you've created not just a model, but a tool that understands the market much more deeply than standard technical analysis. It knows how a specific pair behaves in specific scenarios: when the RSI actually reverses, and when the market continues to fall; when the MACD divergence works, and when it's ignored; where levels become reversal points, and where they're just price push points.

Finetune delivered a noticeable boost in efficiency: win rate increased by almost ten points, drawdowns decreased, and the final profitability became several times higher than with an untrained model.

As a result, you have a fully automated system that analyzes the market every 24 hours, opens trades, sets stops and take profits, and can operate on a VPS 24/7. All you need to do is periodically update the data and monitor stability.

Further improvements—multi-timeframe analysis, self-learning, and model ensembles—will increase the system's robustness and expand its applicability to different market conditions.
