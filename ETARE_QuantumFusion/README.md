# ETARE Quantum Fusion

## 🚀 System Overview
ETARE Quantum Fusion is the next evolution of the Strike Boss trading ecosystem. It fuses the high-probability signals of the ETARE Champion Expert with Quantum Regime Detection and multi-system signal aggregation.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Modules**:
  - `compression_layer.py`: Quantum Autoencoder for Regime Detection (Trend vs. Chaos).
  - `signal_fusion.py`: (Pending) Aggregator for LSTM, 3D Bars, and QPE signals.
  - `etare_enhanced.py`: (Pending) The core neural network updated with fusion inputs.

## 📅 Roadmap
- [x] Phase 1: Project Genesis & Backup
- [x] Phase 2: Quantum Compression Layer Migration
- [ ] Phase 3: Signal Adapters (LSTM, 3D, QPE)
- [ ] Phase 4: Fusion Engine Core
- [ ] Phase 5: Live Bridge Integration

## 🛠️ Usage
The system is currently in development. Modules can be tested individually.
```bash
python modules/compression_layer.py
```
