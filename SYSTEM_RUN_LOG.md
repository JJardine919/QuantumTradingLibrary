# SYSTEM RUN LOG
**Started:** January 24, 2026
**Purpose:** Track verified system connections and successful runs to prevent regression.

## ✅ VERIFIED CONNECTIONS
1.  **Quantum Compressor Source:** `01_Systems/QuantumCompression/deep_quantum_compress_pro.py` confirmed as the "Strike Boss" engine. Contains the correct recursive autoencoder logic and regime detection.
2.  **Workflow Wiring:** `Master_Train.py` successfully links Raw Data -> Compressor -> Trainer.
    - Verified run: Input `btc_downtrend_state.npy` -> Output Accuracy **84.00%**.
    - No manual steps required.

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS
1.  **API Integration:** Checking feasibility of hooking up IBM/Google Quantum hardware.

## 🎯 STRATEGIC GOALS (The "Prop Farm" & Platform)
- **Objective:** Scale from 3 active accounts to ~8-10 accounts (Prop Farm model).
- **Platform:** `Sustai.io` (Domain for membership/dashboard).
- **Stack:** Vercel (Hosting) + N8N (Automation/Workflows) for autonomous operations.
- **Resource:** Secondary Gemini Terminal (available for offloading code tasks/builds).

## 🚀 ADVANCED TRAINING STRATEGY (The "90% Protocol")
- **Concept:** Compressor gives a fixed +12-15% boost. Maximizing the *base* model first yields higher final results.
- **Workflow:**
    1.  **The Bootcamp:** Train on 3 Symbols (Gold, ETH, BTC) x 3 Timeframes = 9 Training Sessions.
    2.  **The Goal:** Raise base accuracy from ~63% to ~75-78% via robust multi-asset exposure.
    3.  **The Boost:** Apply Quantum Compressor *last* to add the +12% regime filter.
    4.  **Target:** 90%+ Win Rate.
- **Note:** Do not overfit. Maintain "chaotic" unseen data for validation.

## 📝 NOTES
- **Lead Agent:** DooDoo (Lead Architect & Strategic Partner).
- **Core Philosophy:** **"No Holding Back."** Deliver the absolute highest quality/accuracy (90% target) available. No restricted or "light" training for the product.
- **Symbol Focus:** **"The Big 3"** (Gold/XAUUSD, ETHUSD, BTCUSD). The system will be ultra-trained specifically on these assets for maximum profitability.
- **Critical Rule:** Do not modify the core build "jamming around". Only surgical fixes.

- **Performance Target:** +15% Win Rate & 100% Regime Recognition via Compressor.
